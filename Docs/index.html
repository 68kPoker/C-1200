<h3>C-1200 Screen Data:</h3><p>
It contains intuition Screen with double-buffering. Once it receives safe to draw message, it sends it to the windows, which may refresh and sync themselves.
The sync process is based on the update flags and the difference between graphics states.

<h3>C-1200 RastPort Data:</h3><p>
It contains additional data like graphics bitmap with mask but also background tiles, list of animated tiles and foreground Bobs.
<h3>C-1200 Gadgets:</h3><p>
These represent various UI controls. All have handlers which process input events from mouse, keyboard, joystick and timers.
They must also care of sync with proper update, graphics state difference control.

<p>Each graphics element, object and control has a <b>current state</b> and <b>two previous states</b>. The previous states are 
    here so that the element knows which graphics part needs to be discarded or updated. Example: Bob has previous positions, so he knows which part of the buffer to discard.

    But there are <b>two update flags</b>, set upon any appearance or position change to simplify state comparison.

    The tile background is drawn whether:
    <ol>
        <li>It is drawn for first time.</li>
        <li>It is animated tile.</li>
        <li>It is located below animated object.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>

    In the 2nd and 3rd case the objects which are not currently updated and located on discard area, must be updated.    
    <h3>C-1200 Tiles (board):</h3><p>

    Tile structure consists of <b>floor type</b>, <b>optional floor ID</b>, <b>optional object type</b> and <b>optional object ID</b>.

    There are arrays containing additional information about identified floors and objects index using the ID.    

    The floor ID is used for example for animated floors. 
    <h3>C-1200 Tiles (graphics):</h3><p>

    The graphics is calculated on floor, object types and additional info.

    For optimization, the tile is redrawn only if there's a difference (based on screen tile sources and layers comparison).

    <p>Cases:
    <ul><li>The single-layer floor without object. It is drawn by <b>single-layer tile blit operation</b>.</li>
        <li>The dual-layer floor is drawn using <b>Dual-layer tile blit operation</b>.</li>
        <li>The single-layer floor with static object is drawn with dual-layer tile blit operation.</li>
        <li>The moving objects are drawn once their previous and current position tile is drawn.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>C-1200 Tiles (user interface):</h3><p>
        The tiles IDs are also used to form user interface controls. The dual-layer may be used for window borders etc.

        The text-box is used with tiles to form text-based controls. The slider-box is used to form sliders.
